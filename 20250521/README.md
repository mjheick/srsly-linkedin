There is a new React interview question making the rounds that is causing a lot of developers significant heart-ache. They are complaining the question is unfair and biased and doesn't really test their knowledge of the job. The question these developers are being asked in interviews is: 

Open up notepad (or VI/VIM/EMACS) and write an HTML 5 compliant web page that displays hello world centered and your name in normal font below the hello world. Use an external css style sheet for formatting. For extra credit create a button that alerts Hello World when clicked using an external JavaScript file. 

Senior React developers are up in arms with how unfair the question is. And worse? No AI allowed, no Internet look-up allowed. They are being forced to code this challenge live and failing. 

What do you think? Is it fair to ask knock-out technical questions? Is this question too hard and too challenging for Senior React Developers with 8 years experience? Is giving an hour not enough time?
